# 1051. Height Checker

## description

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

- example1
 
```
Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```
<br>

- example2

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```
<br>

- example3

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```

## solve

```
var heightChecker = function(heights) {
    const arr = heights
    const tmpArr = [...heights]
    let count = 0;
    for(var i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
        var tmp
        for(var j=i+1; j<arr.length; j++) {
            if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                tmp = arr[i]
                arr[i] = arr[j]
                arr[j] = tmp
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== tmpArr[i]) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    return count
};
```

- parameter인 `heights를 변수 `arr`에 직접 할당하면 `arr`는 `heights`와 동일한 배열을 참조한다.
- 스프레드 연산자('...')를 사용하면 `heights의 복사본을 생성하여 `tmpArr`에 할당한다.
